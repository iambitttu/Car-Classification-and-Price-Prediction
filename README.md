# project
-Firstly import the necessary libraries
-then load the dataset through pandas library
-then do exploratory data analysis
-we see the data whether it has null values or not
-check how many unique features are there in the data
-then see the target unique values
-drop the unnecessary column
-drop the target column & asssign the data a new variable
-draw boxplot by using seaborn library
-after that do feature scaling as use standard scaler
-then X assign as independent variable data & y assign as dependent variable data
-then split into train test where I assign 20% data as test data
-after that apply different types of Machine learning techniques
-check our model score as how efficient it is
